# python-learning-journal
A repository for my python class which I will use forever.
About me: My name is Christopher Marentez and I am learning Python as well as Java so that I may hopefully make it far in this world as well as hopefully working for one of the big tech companies one day. 
One of my biggest goals for this class as well as any class is to learn as much as I can as well as of course hopefully coming out this class with not only the knowledge to show for it, as well as a good grade to show potential businesses that I not only have the knowledge and tools to get ahead, but that I am also able to succeed academicaly.

I will not only try my very hardest to learn what I need to learn, but I also commit to practicing the techniques I learn in this and in every class so that I may continue to better myself even outside of school.
